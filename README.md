ðŸŽ¯ TARGETED FACE DETECTION SYSTEM
A Python-based face detection and registration system specifically engineered for tough conditions where faces are clearly visible to humans but standard face detection algorithms fail. This system combines extreme preprocessing, classic and modern algorithms, multiple detection backends, and detailed diagnostics for maximum robustness.

Features
Space Bar Handling: Bulletproof, multi-method detection

RGB Conversion: Fully error-proof, always reliable

Face Detection: Simultaneously uses 25+ strategies, including:

HOG and CNN (face_recognition)

4 different OpenCV Haar & LBP cascades (frontal, alt, profile)

Extreme preprocessing: gamma, CLAHE, color conversions

Edge detection fallback (Canny/Laplacian)

Multi-scale & morphological operations

Detailed Diagnostics: Full console output shows exactly which method worked/failed

Manual fallback ready: Easily enable manual face box selection if all automated methods fail

Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
Python Environment

It's strongly recommended to use a virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows
Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Main requirements:

opencv-python

dlib

face_recognition

numpy

pandas

tkinter (builtin for most Python installs)

Optional for best performance:

A working webcam

Good lighting

Usage
Run the Main App:

bash
python smart_attendance_system.py   
Key Workflow
TARGETED Camera Test:

Launch the app and click "ðŸŽ¯ TARGETED Camera Test".

Observe the console for exactly which preprocessing and detection methods are being attempted.

Upon detection, face boxes will appear in the camera window, and the console will detail the method that succeeded.

Registration & Attendance:

"ðŸ‘¤ Targeted Register": Capture and enroll new faces.

"ðŸ“¸ Targeted Attendance": Check in with live face recognition.


Troubleshooting
Still No Detection?

Try adjusting lighting (avoid backlight, use front/side lighting).

Remove eyeglasses, scarves, or headwear temporarily.

Move closer/further from the camera.

Try the test at a different time of day (natural vs artificial light).

If using a laptop camera, consider an external USB webcam.

Check Dependencies:

All libraries must be installed and at compatible versions.

Some features (like CNN backend) will run slowly on CPU.
